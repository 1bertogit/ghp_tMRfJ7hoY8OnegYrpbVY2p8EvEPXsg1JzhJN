## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Dark navy blue (#0A0A0F) creates an immersive, sophisticated feel reminiscent of a futuristic medical environment.
- Primary Accent: Soft white (#FFFFFF) with varying opacities (0.02 - 0.18) to create the glassmorphic effect. Simulates the transparent, layered elements of the Vision Pro interface.
- Text: Off-white (#FFFFFF with opacities of 0.50 to 0.95) for readability against the dark background. High contrast ensures elements stand out, aligning with user accessibility and aesthetic preferences.
- Font: '-apple-system', BlinkMacSystemFont, 'SF Pro Display', sans-serif for both headings and body text, giving a clean, modern look and ensures that the typography adheres closely to Apple's design language.
- Glass Components: Floating glass sidebar, content cards with depth and generous spacing, create an organized and easy-to-navigate structure for user.
- Subtle transitions (300-500ms) on hover and focus states, along with glass intensification, offer fluid and engaging experience.
- Use 'Lucide React' icons to visually communicate actions and functionality within the mentorship platform
